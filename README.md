<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Variation among tree species in their environmental tolerances can contribute to species coexistence through niche partitioning1. Topographical distributions of tropical tree species has long been associated with local soil water requirements2â€“5 but, whereas decreasing water availability at higher elevations appears to impose an upper barrier to many species distributions, the factors mediating the lower elevational limits remain unresolved. We experimentally quantified the sensitivity of seedlings of 16 tree species to ephemeral water inundation across micro-topographical gradients and characterised adult tree distributions of these species across a more extensive macro-topographical range using spatial point pattern analysis. We find that a simple additive linear model using seedling inundation sensitivity and wood density weighted by abundance predicts adult distributions (r2 = 0.71). This the model shows fine scale species specific seedling inundation sensitivities reflect wider landscape scale community distributions in tropical forests. Moreover, by controlling for the wetter end of the soil water gradient, a clear relationship emerges between wood density and elevation. This suggests, that niche space is created for high wood density species by a pockets of water inundation in these nutrient rich planes preventing competitive exclusion. Verifying our findings, the model predicted the median elevation of species with an r2 of 0.82 (n = 13), and individuals (n = 279) at r2 of 0.36 in independent plots. Thus, differential seedling responses to water inundation captures larger scale filtering processes that determine adult topographical distributions. A trade-off between drought and water inundation tolerances likely structures dipterocarp tree distributions along elevation gradients. In view of this, increasingly variable rainfall amplitude in the region6 is likely to affect the spatial structure, species composition, and diversity of future forests.</p>
